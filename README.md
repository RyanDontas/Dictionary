newtext.txt:
and does not last an eternity like romantic love.
as a disposition and not as a bunch of actions. 
Like I expected, the judge defends the classical 
notion of philosophy to A.

simple.txt:
the ground was a frozen blanket 
the color of milk in a cereal bowl.
I gathered stones that melted in my palm,
in a pile they were like overgrown skittles.
the sky is crying the tears that bring new life.
my heart was beating for joy.

poem.txt:
goose and moose.
it is hard to tell just what a goose
will have in common with a moose.
or better yet, just what three geese 
will have in common with three meese.
I will say this once, I will say this thrice,
the plural for moose is mice,
or plural for three mice is messes.
I think that I may fall to pieces.
I feel my dizzy state increase 
about the mice, the grice and geese.
